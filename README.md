# Drawing Recognition Project

## Overview
This project is a Drawing Recognition tool developed as part of my exploration into computer vision and pattern recognition, without using external libraries. The tool is capable of recognizing and interpreting drawings made by the user.

### Inspired by Radu Mariescu-Istodor
Special thanks to Radu Mariescu-Istodor for his invaluable tutorial, which inspired this project. You can find more of his insightful content on [his YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3XGlNq8O5hZlZBJlSFB4jg).

## How it Works
The project is built using pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It implements basic concepts of image processing and pattern recognition:
- Capturing user drawing input.
- Analyzing the drawing pattern.
- Comparing it to predefined patterns to find a match.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Start drawing on the canvas provided and see the tool in action.
